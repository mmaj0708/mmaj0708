## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been studying digital structure at 42 Paris school for 3 years now.
After exploring some web projects, I'm currently focusing on developing my software skills, mastering C and C++ and starting some Python projects. I also learned to develop DeFi applications with Solidity language for fun !

#### My Portfolio is here : [melchiormaj.com](https://www.melchiormaj.com)

ðŸ”­ My prettiest projects are:
- [x] [ft_transcendence](https://github.com/mmaj0708/ft_transcendence) - Build a website to play pong games (TypeScript frameworks)
- [x] [Webserv](https://github.com/mmaj0708/Webserv) - reproduce a tiny nginx server (C++)
- [x] [Kubernetes & clustering](https://github.com/mmaj0708/ft_services) - setting up an infrastructure providing differents services (BASH)
